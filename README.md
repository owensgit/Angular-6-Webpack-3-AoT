# Angular 6, Webpack 3, AoT Compilcation & Lazy Loading

This is simple project which contains a custom Webpack 3 config for Angular 6, including support for Ahead of Time Compilation (AoT) and lazy loading of Angular modules.

I've kept the versions at Angular 6 and Webpack 3 to use as reference and experiementation, for working with an older app stuck on these versions.
